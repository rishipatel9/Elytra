## Getting Started  

To get this project running on your local machine, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites  

Make sure the following software is installed:  

- Node.js >= 16  
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun  
- Prisma CLI: `npm install -g prisma`

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/elytra.git  
   cd elytra  
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  

   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following example variables:  

   ```env  
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=  
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=  
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=  
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=  
   NEXT_SECRET=  
   DATABASE_URL=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_JWT_SECRET=  
   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=  
   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=  
   LIVEKIT_URL=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINECONE_API_KEY=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=  
   OPENAI_API_KEY=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NODEMAILER_PASS=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIL_ADD=  
   ```

   Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials for services like Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, LiveKit, Pinecone, and OpenAI.

4. Run Prisma commands to set up your database:

   - Pull the schema from the database (if you have an existing schema):
     ```bash
     npx prisma db pull
     ```

   - Run migrations (for any changes to your schema):
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate dev
     ```

   - Generate the Prisma client:
     ```bash
     npx prisma generate
     ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js development server, which you can view at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Docker Setup  

To run Elytra using Docker, follow these steps to ensure that your environment is properly configured.

### Prerequisites

Before running Elytra in Docker, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Docker Compose** (optional but recommended for multi-container setups)

### Running Elytra with Docker

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/elytra.git
   cd elytra
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t elytra .
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (if not already done). This should contain your environment variables for the services you are using (e.g., OpenAI API key, Google OAuth credentials, etc.).

   Example `.env` file:

   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=  
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=  
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=  
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=  
   NEXT_SECRET=  
   DATABASE_URL=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_JWT_SECRET=  
   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=  
   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=  
   LIVEKIT_URL=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINECONE_API_KEY=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=  
   OPENAI_API_KEY=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NODEMAILER_PASS=  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIL_ADD=  
   ```

4. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 elytra
   ```

   This command will start the app, and you can access it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Accessing the Application

Once the Docker container is running, the application will be accessible on your local machine at `http://localhost:3000`. You can use your browser to interact with the app.

### Stopping the Docker Container

To stop the running container, press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal or use the following command to stop it:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

You can get the `container_id` by running `docker ps` to list all running containers.
